**How to execute binary:**


To run the project you can use the jar inside of testasaitec/build/libs/testasaitec-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar


you can execute it like the example below

`java -jar testasaitec-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar path/to/products.txt path/to/order.txt`


**Considerations**

No dependency injection framework was used, once there were no need for it and I think this makes things easier to check real habilities.

All the data is stored in memory and there is no persistence involved.


All the files were commited in the repository so you can access the binary .
